# UCP Input Handler

This repository contains a module for the "Unofficial Crusader Patch Version 3" (UCP3), a modification for Stronghold Crusader.
This module exposes the possibility to add certain events to inputs, or re-define already present key combinations.

**Heavy work in progress, no functionality at the moment**
